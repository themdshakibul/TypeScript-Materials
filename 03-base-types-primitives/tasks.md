#  03 - Assignment / Task

## Task 1 — Type Identification

```ts
const username = "tapas";
const age = 35;
const verified = true;
const accountId = 12345678901234567890n;
const token = Symbol("token");
```

Write down the inferred type of every variable before hovering over it in your editor.

## Task 2 — Build a User Model

Create a TypeScript type for a user with:

- id as a number
- name as a string
- isActive as a boolean
- email that can be a string or null
- lastLogin that can be a Date or undefined

## Task 3 — unknown Challenge

```ts
function printValue(value: unknown) {
  // Your code here
}
```

Make the function safely print the value only when it is a string. Then add a second branch for numbers.

## Task 4 — never Challenge

Create a function called throwError that accepts a string message and always throws an Error. Give it the correct return type.

## Task 5 — Spot the Problems

```ts
function processUser(name: String, age: Number, data: any) {
  return data.user;
}
```

Identify at least three problems with this code. Rewrite it using better TypeScript types. If the structure of data is genuinely unknown, explain why unknown may be preferable to any.

## Bonus Challenge — Runtime + Type System

```ts
function formatValue(value: unknown) {
  // Handle strings
  // Handle numbers
  // Handle booleans
  // Handle everything else
}
```

Implement this using typeof checks. Try to make TypeScript narrow the value correctly in every branch.
